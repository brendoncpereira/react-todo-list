# Simple TO-DO List with ReactJS ðŸ“‹

This project is a to-do list created with ReactJS that I'm using to improve my skills in the React ecosystem, especially the concepts and practice of React Hooks, props, and componentization.

The project is still ongoing, and so far, some basic functions have been implemented, such as adding and deleting tasks and a button to switch the site's appearance to dark mode.

## Below I leave an updated checklist with some tasks to be implemented in the project:
 
### Checklist - Functions to be implemented
